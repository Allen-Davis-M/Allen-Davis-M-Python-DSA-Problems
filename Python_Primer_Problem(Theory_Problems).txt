
1.8) If s[k] references index -n<k<0 then the equivalent index j>=0 should ideally be j=n+k
Taking an example if n=7 and k=4, therefore j=-7+4=-3
both s[4] and s[-3] would reference the same thing in a list of 7 elements

1.16)Even though numbers are immutable, in a list the value corresponding to a certain position in the list can be changed by a certain factor with respect to user input, therefore this change will affect the original list

1.17)We would not be modifying the list in this particular instance, instead we would be creating a copy of a particular list element and modifying that to the particular value that we desired
